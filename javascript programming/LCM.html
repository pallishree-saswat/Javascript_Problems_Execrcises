To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following JavaScript programming topics:

JavaScript if...else Statement
JavaScript while and do...while Loop
JavaScript for loop
The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by both integers.

For example, the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24. */ 
    // program to find the LCM of two integers

// take input
const num1 = prompt('Enter a first positive integer: ');
const num2 = prompt('Enter a second positive integer: ');

// higher number among number1 and number2 is stored in min
let min = (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;

// while loop
while (true) {
    if (min % num1 == 0 && min % num2 == 0) {
      document.write(`The LCM of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${min}`);
        break;
    }
    min++;
